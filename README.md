# SquirrelWars

This is my entry for the Random Name Jam. It's called 'In Search of the Squirrel Wars' and it's an old school text adventure.

## Misc
For the love of god, please don't look at the code! It's messy, and ugly, and I will have to redo all of it.

## Installation
Linux & Mac: Use the makefile. It should compile without problems.

### Detailed Installation
If you don't know what a makefile is (mostly applies to Mac users, I guess):
Download the Zip (on the right). Unpack it to a folder of your choosing. ("/Users/<yourusername>/Downloads/SquirrelWars-master", for instance) Launch your Terminal/Console (on Mac: type Terminal.app into Spotlight). Navigate to your folder (type cd "/Users/<yourusername>/Downloads/SquirrelWars-master", for instance). Type make. Wait .5 seconds. (on Mac: you might have to download the Developer Command Line Tools, which will make the waiting time longer.) Then type ./SquirrelWars. That should do it. :)
