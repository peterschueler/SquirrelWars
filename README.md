# SquirrelWars

This is my entry for the Random Name Jam. It's called 'In Search of the Squirrel Wars' and it's an old school text adventure.

## Misc
For the love of god, please don't look at the code! It's messy, and ugly, and I will have to redo all of it.

## Installation
Linux & Mac: Use the makefile. It should compile without problems.
